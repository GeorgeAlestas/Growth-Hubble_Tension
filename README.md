## Abstract
Many late time approaches for the solution of the Hubble tension use a late time smooth deformation of the Hubble expansion rate <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H(z)"> of the Planck18/ΛCDM best fit <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H(z)"> to match the locally measured value of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H_0"> while effectively keeping the comoving distance to the last scattering surface <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r(z_{rec})"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\omega_m\equiv \Omega_{0m} h^2"> fixed to maintain consistency with Planck CMB measurements. A well known problem of these approaches is that they worsen the fit to low  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> distance probes (BAO and SnIa). Here we show that another problem of these approaches is to worsen the level of the  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Omega_{0m}-\sigma_8"> growth tension. We use the CPL parametrization of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H(z)"> corresponding to evolving dark energy equation of state parameter  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(z)=w_0%2Bw_1\frac{z}{1%2Bz}"> with local measurements <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H_0"> prior and fixed values of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Omega_{0m} h^2"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r(z_{rec})"> and identify the pairs <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(w_0, w_1)"> that satisfy these conditions. We show that for these models the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Omega_{0m}-\sigma_8"> tension between dynamical probe data (redshift space distortions) and CMB constraints is worse than the corresponding tension that appears in the case of the standard Planck18/ΛCDM model. We justify this feature using  a full numerical solution of the growth equation and fit to the data  and also using approximate analytic properties of the growth factor of perturbations <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\delta \rho}{\rho}(z)"> solution. This  problem of late time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H(z)"> deformations is similar to a corresponding problem that exists for early time approaches to the Hubble crisis which also tend to increase the growth tension. The problem does not affect recent proposed solutions of the Hubble crisis involving a low <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z"> gravitational transition that actually can resolve the growth tension.
